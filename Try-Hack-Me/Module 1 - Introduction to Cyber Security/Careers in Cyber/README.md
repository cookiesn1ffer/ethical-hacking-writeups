## TL;DR
Quick intro to common cyber roles (defensive, offensive, DFIR, malware, red team, etc.). Good for picking a path. Short read, no heavy hands-on.

---

## Summary (no spoilers)
Room lists roles, core responsibilities, and useful skills for each. Ends with a small quiz to help you reflect on what fits you. Nothing to hack — purely career guidance.

---

## How I did it
- Read every page fast.  
- Wrote 1-line notes per role: mission / daily / 1 skill to practice.  
- Did the quiz to confirm first choice. That’s it.

---

## Key takeaways
- Cyber splits into defender, attacker, and specialist tracks.  
- Roles need different mindsets — pick one and practise.  
- Hands-on rooms validate interest faster than theory.

---

## Recommended next steps
- Pick one role you liked from this room.  
- Do 2 practical rooms for that track (e.g., SOC/DFIR for defensive; Intro pentest/offensive for attacker).  
- Learn basics: Linux, networking, and a bit of scripting.  
- Build one small project (log parsing script / basic vuln writeup).

---

## Tools & skills mentioned
- Networking basics, Linux fundamentals.  
- Scripting (Python/Bash) for automation.  
- SIEM/log analysis for defenders.  
- nmap/gobuster/basic web tools for offensive path.  

---

## Personal note
Short and useful. Took ~15 minutes. If you’re confused, repeat the room after doing a couple of practical labs — your preference usually becomes clearer.
